# GDL-Script
In this repository I will store my GDL's script which I used to analyze the data set obtained by cosmological simulations developed with ENZO code

all.pro is a collection of GDL procedure which I used to compute, analyze and plot the results of the analysis of the cosmological simulations developed with ENZO code and presented in scientific paper by Dr. Franco Vazza. Fo any details about the functions developed in all.pro, please contact me at matteo.angelinelli@gmail.com
